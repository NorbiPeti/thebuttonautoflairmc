# Chroma-Chat plugin
A plugin that provides markdown formatting, name mentioning and other chat features.

## Components

### Announcer
This component simply sends messages globally based on a configurable list in a given interval.

### Append text
This component allows the players to put tableflips and other texts after their messages using /tableflip and other commands.

### Chat-only
This component lets a player become invincible at the cost of not being able to move. It was made for chat clients.

### Flair
This component downloads /r/TheButton flairs from Reddit for users who comment in a specific thread. This was the original function of the plugin.

### Formatter
This component provides the Markdown and other formatting and name mentioning.

### Fun
This component has some random things I added for fun, including "Press F to pay respects" and rainbow chat.

### Town colors
This component allows mayors and kings to set a color for their town/nation, which sets each resident's name colors and also shows on Dynmap.

### Towny
This component is needed by the town colors component. Besides, it reads Towny events to be broadcasted to Discord, if that plugin is used.
